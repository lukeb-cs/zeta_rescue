FINAL PROJECT CHECKPOINT TWO

**What goals of the project have you accomplished?**
	We have written code for the navigation of the robot and are in the process of troubleshooting and testing right now. We have also written code to detect aruco markers, and we were able to verify that this code works as well using the aruco simulation that was given to us. Lastly, we have code written for the capture and storage of images of the aruco markers as well as reporting the victims when needed, however we still need to test this. 
**What goals are you stuck on how to proceed?**
	We’re currently stuck on transforming coordinates from the camera frame to the map frame in order to correctly get the positions of the aruco code markers. We’re going to use the example code provided to solve this problem.
**What still needs to be completed?**
	We still need to do a lot of testing within the simulation and fix any problems that will inevitably rise during this process. We also need to test with the actual robot once we finalize our code and make sure that the code works with the physical robot so that we are ready to go for the competition day. Lastly, we still need to write our launch file and test that as well.
