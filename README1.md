FINAL PROJECT CHECKPOINT 1

**What goals of the project have you accomplished?**
We have a code written that has the ability to detect the color orange around the map, and on the simulation, when controlling it through teleop, we have been able to identify the orange beam in the simulation. We have also written code for the robot to traverse the map systematically using randomization.
**What goals are you stuck on how to proceed?**
At the moment, because it is early in the project, we haven’t gotten stuck on many goals. There are some skills that we have to review that were taught early in the semester, but it is simply a matter of reviewing old material and reminding ourselves of ROS2 and packages.	
**What goals do you think you will finish before the Thanksgiving break?**	
	Before Thanksgiving break, we plan to have the robot systematically traverse and detect the Aruco markers and have orange detection as well and add these victims to the list, and we want the robot to be able to go there once it detects it. We also want the robot to be able to take pictures of the victims.
